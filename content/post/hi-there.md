**I am Prritam! _Yes, with a double ‘r’!_**

Single ‘r’ is too mainstream.

Also, ‘pritam.com’, with a single ‘r’, was already taken.

Anyway, the world is not a fair place for honest people (and this is just one of the many rationally cynical beliefs I hold). That my namesake, who is infamous for copying others’ musical tracks. shows up in the search engine result page when you search for ‘Pritam’ is testimony to this. So, yeah. It’s Prritam - with a double ‘r’, to make ego-surfing easy!

I am a Content Marketer/Editor by profession, Electronics & Communication Engineer by degree (also, have a Masters in Journalism & Mass Communication), wannabe writer and artist, and self-proclaimed **_‘Patron Saint of Atheists & Other Nonconformists’_**.

Gosh! Seems like I am so confused!

What happened was that after graduating in 2013 as an Electronics and Communication Engineer, I joined the telecom industry as a trainee engineer. 6 months into the job and I realised engineering is not for me.

No, I don’t hate technology. I just love arts more. As a kid, I used to spend hours making sketches.

And at night, whenever there’s a power cut, I would keep away my sketchbooks and pencils, sit beside my grandpa and listen to his stories. He used to write as well and eventually, I fell in love with writing.

Later in my life, I picked up photography.

My heart beats for arts of every kind. But arts do not pay the bills.

I quit my engineering career and went back to college, to do my Masters in Journalism and Mass Communication. I thought I would become a journalist.

‘I write well and I do photography,’ I thought. ‘I am politically aware, well-read, argumentative and opinionated. I should become a journalist.’

At the end of two years, I realised even journalism is not my cup of tea, coffee or whatever.

Today, when I think of all these things, I realise I had spent the first 27 years of my life just to find out _where I don’t want to be_.

Anyway, at last, I joined the content marketing team of an AI-based edutech. This is where everything I learned all these years came useful - writing, sketching, photography, even engineering.

I couldn’t become an artist, or a writer, a professional photographer, an engineer or a journalist. But I picked everything I could all along this long and tedious journey.

And the amalgamation of all these things helped me become good at what I do now - marketing. I got three appraisals and a promotion in just two years. So, I believe I am doing good.

There is, however, one problem. Sometimes, I miss the good old days - the kind of writings I used to write. _(‘Writings I used to write’ doesn’t sound OK but let’s just ignore it for now.)_ These days I barely get time to look around me for stories and even if I stumble upon one, I find it extremely difficult to _storify_ them.

So, this blog is my superficial attempt at getting back to writing. I hope, against all hope, that I will feel obligated to write… Even if it’s illegible scribbles…
