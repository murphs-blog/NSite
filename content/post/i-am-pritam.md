**Hi! I am Pritam! I am a Content Marketer by profession!**

After graduating in 2013 as an Electronics and Communication Engineer, I joined the telecom industry as a trainee engineer. 6 months in the job and I realised engineering is not for me.

No, I don't hate technology. I just love arts more. As a kid, I used to spend hours making sketches.

And at night, whenever there's a power cut, I would keep away my sketchbooks and pencils, sit beside my grandpa and listen to his stories. He used to write as well and eventually, I fell in love with writing.

Later in my life, I picked up photography.

My heart beats for arts of every kind. But arts do not pay bills.

I quit my engineering career and went back to college, to do my Masters in Journalism and Mass Communication. I thought I would become a journalist.

'I write well and I do photography,' I thought. 'I am politically aware, well-read, argumentative and opinionated. I should become a journalist.'

At the end of two years, I realised even journalism is not my cup of tea, coffee or whatever.

Today, when I think of all these things, I realise I had spent the first 27 years of my life just to find out _where I don't want to be_.

Anyway, at last, I joined the content marketing team of an AI company. This is where everything I learned all these years came useful - writing, sketching, photography, even engineering.

I couldn't become an artist, or a writer, a professional photographer, an engineer or a journalist. But I picked everything I could all along this long and tedious journey. And the amalgamation of all these things helped me become good at what I do - marketing. I have transformed marketing itself into art.

Within two years, I got three appraisals and a promotion.
