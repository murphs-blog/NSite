Because of some turbulence in space and time  
A bouquet of flowers from the lost days  
Of forgotten dreams reached her today...  
And he walked back from some time in the future  
Not knowing that it would lead him  
To those lost days of forgotten dreams...

And the winter notes of the ladybug   
Came to an abrupt start  
And then time stopped forever..
