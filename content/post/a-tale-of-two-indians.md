Kormangala is one such place in Bangalore where the two Indias exist side by side. Every now and then you could see a Mercedes or a BMW making its way through the crowded roads amidst the auto rickshaws. And then a horse driven cart might appear out of nowhere. Look randomly at any direction and you would see women looking like those girls in magazines (thanks to expensive imported cosmetics) coming out of big showrooms of foreign brands, their hands full of bags. On the other hand, college students could be seen bargaining with road side shopkeepers selling kurtis, wallets or sunglasses. In the evening, the sound from the night clubs and pubs could be heard even when the honking of vehicular horns are at their highest level. The air is filled with the smell of expensive wines and the cacophony of iPhones and Chinese mobiles is more audible now.

But it is not these contrasts that's worth writing about. Amidst these chaos of coexistence of the two Indias, I saw a person and it was him who was the living testimony of the two Indias I was speaking about.

I was in an auto stuck at a traffic signal in Kormangala yesterday and this kid, 7-8 years old came over and asked me to buy a pen from him. Initially I showed no interest, had it been a few years back, I would have probably taken him to a nearby restaurant and fed him. But my life as a vagabond artist has changed me.

Anyway, he said that he hadn't eaten anything since last night. So I gave him a ten rupee note and told him that I didn't need a pen.

A part of me thought that probably he would be happy, for this would have been an extra income. His 'malik' wouldn't know about it...

But the boy took the ten rupee note, kept a pen on the seat of the auto and ran away. I peeked out but he was lost in the crowd.

And I realized that with all his poverty, he was a rich kid... And that was something that represented the true nature of the existence of two Indias together... For these coexistence was not 'side by side' but at the same place, or to be precise in the same body...
