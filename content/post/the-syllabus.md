When I was a kid,  
Every evening, my mom  
After returning from work,  
Would ask me  
If I had finished my homework.

"Not yet. I was making this painting, mummy."

Then I would show her   
My paintings,

Or sometimes, my writings with lots of spelling errors,  
Or an unpleasant tune that I had composed  
On my harmonium  
\- No offence meant to the harmonium by the way.

And she would say, "It's beautiful...  
But you need to do your homework first.  
You need to complete the syllabus..."

I never got the point.

When my two weeks old goldfish  
Died and floated inside the fish bowl,  
I asked her why it died.

Despite knowing that it died  
Because I couldn't take care of it.

"Because it circled round and round  
In the world created by you.  
And it was busy completing its syllabus, you see.  
A syllabus that you made...  
And forgot..."
