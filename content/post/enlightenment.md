2012 was the year an apple dropped on my head... And I was enlightened.

And it happened when I was in a contemplative mood. No, actually I was sulking. Not under a tree though. I was sitting with my friends at our farewell program in college.

I was going to step into my professional life as an engineer. But I wasn't happy. Firstly, because engineering wasn't something I wanted to do... I liked writing, and sketching... And engineering was imposed upon me. And second, even though I had given my hundred percent in that course, for my parents had spent so much on me, and I didn't want to disappoint them, the course had disappointed me... The education system had disappointed me.

So I went to the farewell program in an old shirt and a pair of crumpled trousers (the dress code was complete suit), I hadn't shaved for days, and my hair was not combed. It was my way of protesting against engineering, against everything that got me into this course...

And I was sulking.

The Chief Guest at the program was giving a long lecture. I was bored even though I wasn't even listening to him. I thought he was bigshot from one of the IT companies.

It was my last day in college, and I had good memories there. So I decided to listen to him.

It seemed like he was a journalist. I don't remember why a journalist was invited at a farewell program in an engineering college; I had missed more than half of his lecture, for I wasn't present there, mentally.

But once I paid attention to his speech, I got the interest. He was speaking about professional ethics, and responsibilities, and citing examples from the experiences of his career (in a humble manner though).

It has been almost 4 years, and I don't remember everything he said. All I remember is his fights against IIPM and Arindam Choudhury, the fraudster, and the things he had to endure in the process.

I got super-excited. I realized this was exactly something I wanted to do... I want to write and make a difference...

But I was an engineer... And I have to work as an engineer to pay the study loan my parents had taken to make me an engineer...

After the program got over, I asked a few students who the Chief Guest was. None of them could tell his name.

Eventually I forgot about him, but I couldn't forget the realization, what I wished to become... I couldn't ignore that moment of enlightenment at that program while listening to a nameless journalist.

I got a job in the engineering field. I started working.

But I wasn't happy. I would spend most of my time in office reading and writing (I was in the telecommunication sector, and I had enough time in my office for all these things).

But after an year, I got tired of living this life. I quit my job, my engineering career. And it took me another year to decide that I seriously wanted to become a journalist.

And I joined one of the best colleges in Bangalore for this course. I am doing good, and my teachers and classmates think that I will become a good journalist. But I had forgotten that man, the Chief Guest at our farewell program in engineering college: the man with no name.

Anyway I was now hyperactive on social media. One day, someone changed their profile picture. And the face looked like someone I had come across before...

It took me a while to realize that it was the same man who was the Chief Guest at our farewell program, the day an apple fell on my head, and I was enlightened...

I had no idea of it though, when I added him...

Thank you, [Peri Maheshwer](https://www.facebook.com/peri.maheshwer?__tn__=%2CdK-R-R&eid=ARDB3KVYaxLk4HLYxoGp-RdoOebBCEs019qhpglGOxaG7W_X8GauJm5cfo5W5bHyDLpl5jZrVJo-6YxO&fref=mentions "Peri Maheshwer") sir... It was because of you I realized what exactly I wanted to do, and I acted accordingly.

And this was the best decision of my life...
