This incident at a certain book shop nearby where an Amazon Echo has been installed made my day ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜†

A certain customer uncle, to check Alexa's intelligence, asks, "Alexa, what time is it in London?"

Alexa tells him the time in London. The uncle finds it amusing. "Let me check in Google," he says. Then finds that Alexa was right. "This is really intelligent," he chuckles.

A kid, barely 2-3 years old, who was among those around the virtual assistant, comes forward.

Amidst all the commotion, he asks, "Alexa, who's your master?"

For whatever reason, Alexa doesn't respond.

The kid looks at uncle ji in disgust and says, "This is stupid and so are you..."
