As a kid, everytime I would finish reading a book, an inexplicably happy feeling of accomplishment would overcome me. I would write the name of the book and its author's name in a diary every time I finished one. And everytime while adding a new book to the list, I would read the names of the titles added earlier, from the beginning.

Initially it meant nothing, but as the number of books in the list reached in hundreds, it gave me an immense pleasure reading the whole list right from the top - from fairy tales and fantasy books to detective novels to more serious stuffs like Kaalbela, Prothom Aalo or The Satanic Verses. I could see a reflection of me growing up going through this list - how my taste for books evolved with time.

Anyway, by the time I was sixteen or seventeen, I had stopped writing in that diary (the last entry was no. 1353,as far as I remember. No wonder, I had never been much interested in making a girlfriend in my school days while some of my friends were already in their second relationship).

Last night I had a dream. And in that dream, I saw this long lost list again, with more titles added to it. And the best part was: it ended with a book written by me. I do not remember the title of the book though.

And it felt great when the forgotten lores of childhood met the extinguished reality of today. Because a part of me still hopes that someday I will write a book worth reading...
