Like Gaiman, I too have been making a list of the things they don't teach you at school.

They don't teach you to be rational at times when rationality is demanded, and emotional, when the situation demands you to be emotional. They don't teach you that hatred and love are equally important feelings.They don't teach you how to move on.

They don't teach you how to deal with your teachers when you couldn't do your homework because of some real problems in your personal life: something you need to know to convince your boss in your working life when you miss the deadline.

They don't teach you how to deal with bullies and teach them a lesson.

They don't teach you not to discriminate.They don't teach you that others are equally important as you are.

They don't teach you to stand up for something you love. They don't teach you to fight.

They don't teach you how to use the first aid box. They don't teach you how to fix things, including someone's heart.

They don't teach you to not lose your mind if you become rich. They don't teach you to pass it forward, everything that you are blessed with...

They don't teach you that Arts is equally important as Science or Commerce.

Knowing quadratic equations, and reaction between sulphuric acid and water doesn't really help much in real life.

No, they don't teach you anything worth knowing.
