There is bone  
And flesh over it  
And somewhere in between  
They say there is a mind  
And possibly a soul  
Which, they say, has a mate  
Out there in the maddening crowd  
Of other bones with  
Fleshes over them  
And you look for your mate  
Rubbing someone's clit  
Or giving someone a blowjob  
But all you get is bone and flesh over it  
And no soul  
And then you realize  
There is no mate here.

So you move to a new place  
A new city,  
To a new building  
And there, every night  
When the stars, you think,  
Are shining for you, you bring  
Someone,  
Your heart refilled with  
The romance of eternal hope,  
Sometimes, you even think  
You have got it,  
Until next morning  
When the room stinks of body fluids.

And it continues  
Until a particular day arrives,  
When you are again  
In a new place, a new city,  
A new building,  
Your bones too weak  
To lift the weight of your flesh and a devasted mind,  
Where the owner locks  
The front gate every night  
At 10 p.m.  
And you, like a lunatic,  
Feel like running into the dark.  
You, and a black cat with green eyes, like  
One of your past lovers,  
Stuck inside the gate,  
Staring outside.

And then you see  
The cat making its way through the gap  
And you realise  
There was never a soul  
Only bone and flesh over it  
And probably a mind  
But no soul.  
And you take a pen  
To write the last poem,  
Smiling, the first true smile.

What's the difference then?  
"That I can smile," I say,  
"That's what love is,"  
It's just feeling good.  
It's just making someone feel good...
