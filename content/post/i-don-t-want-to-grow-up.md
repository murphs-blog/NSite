Being a filmy person can get you into trouble... 😐

So, a senior of mine was sitting beside me at office and working on her computer. A mosquito appeared from somewhere and was bothering her.

She tried to drive it away but it kept on bothering her.

The SRK (from Devdas) in me rose and unlike the usual way people "hunt" mosquitoes - crushing it in between their hands by a measured and targeted clap in the air, I caught it by my hand.

I opened my palm and there it was - crushed and dead - which boosted my filmy feelings.

I was almost going to say, "Paaro, tumhe koi aur chhuye ye mujhe achha nahi lagta..."😂

But then I realised:

1\. It's office, not college  
2\. She's my senior   
3\. She's married

Thank goodness, I didn't say that. I wonder what would have been her reaction to that.

I also realised that the office culture has set in me and that I was growing up...

But I don't want to grow up 😢
