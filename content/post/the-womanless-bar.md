So, last night I went to that cheap bar again,

The one where I had made a _autowallah_ friend.

This time I sat beside a man who happened to be

A _cigarettewalah_ during day

And a _autowallah_ by night - an unusual combination,

Also, it seemed unusual for an autowalah

Who's an autowalah only at night

To be at a bar on a weekend, getting drunk,

When the expensive bars in the city are crowded

By the the ones who can afford to pay

Even five hundred bucks to reach home two blocks away...

He said that he was taking a break,

And "Also Uber has taken down our 'bizness'..."

I liked his honesty.

Then he told me how worried he was,

Because the newly imposed tax was going to hurt his daytime 'bizness'

And we both cursed the government, of course,

Because I smoke.

And then we wondered how it would impact the price of alcohol.

He threw his chappals at the counter,

As if the man at the counter,

Who always looked bored and mechanical,

(I don't blame him for that)

Was responsible for all these...

The man at the counter didn't even notice.

No, he wasn't drunk. He was

Busy selling cheap thrills...

My one-night-friend, frustrated, went to the counter

To get his chappals.

When he got back to his seat

He said, "Look at this place,

People are least bothered... about everything.."

The same reason why I like this place

\- It's a place where an autowalah and his passenger

Forget everything and become friends...

"You know why?" he asked...

"Why?"

"Because it's a womanless bar..."

It wasn't the most politically correct explanation

But reality stuck me

For it was indeed a womanless bar.

And I felt disturbed...

And I came out of the bar,

Not to come here again.

But here I am writing this today,

Sitting at the same bar, same table,

With a day labourer,

Who was missing his wife he had to leave behind

In some village in Bihar, and was

Singing a Hindi folk song remembering her,

Before he passed out...

And I realize

That it's all about convenience...

Or maybe it's about love...

For alcohol, women, or even revolution.

I wonder how this one-night-friend of mine

Who was missing his love,

Would react if he wakes up now and finds his wife

Sitting beside him at this bar...

Love and revolution too is about convenience

For most of us...

This time I finished my drink...

And I came out...
