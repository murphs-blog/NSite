One of my earliest memories has a tape/cassette player that is lying, neglected, in one corner of our bedroom...

I remember, as a kid, I used to ask Maa what it was, and she used to say, "It sings..."

I don't remember it ever 'singing'...

Not until my youngest uncle took over it a few years later, when he was madly in love with a girl, and needed a background music while sleeping, to fantasise himself as SRK and his girl (who is my aunt now) as Kajol, for DDLJ had just released...

The tape/cassette player was one of the few gifts my mom had got in her marriage... It was presented to her by one of her friends who was a 'legal witness' to her court marriage with my dad...

She probably didn't know what she was signing up for... I don't blame my Utopian mother, for one's charm, just like one's looks could be deceiving; I am talking about my father, if you don't get it... He is still the most charming guy I have ever seen in my life...

Anyway, my mother landed up in an orthodox (and misogynist; the two are mostly synonymous though) family, a family so conservative that they believed that their daughter-in-law, chosen by their son, didn't have the right to listen to music when she was free, and not making tea, rice, roti, sabji, fish and chicken curry for them, even though she, the daughter-in-law was helping the family financially...

My mother had told me, I remember, that everytime she wanted to play a cassette, when she was done with all her chores, my father would just leave the room, for he didn't want to give his parents and other members of the family an impression that he was having a 'good time' with his wife...that he hadn't become a 'Joru Ka Gulaam'...

Our culture allows the males to have good time with their female counterparts only when they are having sex... for it is productive, you see ; the family will get an heir to inherit their orthodox, misogynistic culture and traditions...

My mother was Utopian. But at the same time she was practical. And that's why she never played any music on that device, for it might make her life in her in-laws' house more miserable... Yes, it was already miserable... for they, her in-laws, would have made her life more hellish if she'd enjoyed music when her husband had left the bedroom...

When I was 15 years old, my mom bought a big plot of land, and built a house. She never quit her job, even though my father's orthodox, misogynist family had always been pissed off with her because my mother was a working woman, earning more than any of the males in the family...

The day we were packing our stuffs, and everybody in the family was shedding crocodile tears (or may be real tears, for they were sad because they couldn't stop this woman, my mom, from achieving freedom), she, my mother, looked at the tape/cassette player while I was cleaning it (for it now belonged to me, after my uncle left for higher studies), and said, "Everything happened because of this player... I wouldn't have tried to reach where I have reached today had they not stopped you from SINGING..."

Then my mother looked at me and said, "Never let anyone stop you from speaking what's on your mind... even if it's against everything close to you, even if it's against everything you love (she was talking about her husband)... They didn't allow me to play music in MY cassette player in this house... Imagine how much it will hurt me if the world stops YOU, my Creation, from what you are supposed to do, if they stop you from speaking up your mind... doing what you want to do... Never stop yourself from doing what you want to do as long as it doesn't do any harm to others, rationally..."

And that's the reason why I am the way I am... Unapologetic, even when I hurt my mom at times... Fearless, even though I am a so-called human by conventional standards...

And I will continue to be like that...

Bear with me or get lost...
