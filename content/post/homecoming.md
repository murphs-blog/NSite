As I woke up this morning, I remembered a Bengali folk song for no reason:

> Mon amar pagla ghora re,  
> O amar pagla ghora re,  
> Koi thaika koi loiya jas...

Which roughly translates to - My mind is like a mad horse, it makes me wander - something like that.

I do not know why I remembered this song all of a sudden. I do not even listen to this sort of music anymore.

Anyway, I started missing home and north-east all of a sudden. It has been more than two and half years...

I had planned to go home this December. My leave was approved long back. But I was having second thoughts. Especially after mom started nagging me about getting married. So, I had given up my plan...

But this song changed my mind.

I called up my mom; "I am coming home this week...," I told her...
