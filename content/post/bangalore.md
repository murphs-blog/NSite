Life in Bangalore started as a lump in the throat. Back in my school days, I had never imagined myself landing up here... I cracked a few entrances but didn't get any college or branch of my choice and I had to come here. And I hated it here the day I landed. It was on the same day I lost my best friend...

I still remember how I called my dad unable to cross the wide road during the busy traffic hours. I was so scared...

College started and I tucked myself away in a corner, it was the first day and this guy from a small town (and that was not the only reason, I was socially awkward too) was scared among the highly sophisticated boys and girls from one of the biggest cities in India, the majority of whom speaks in a funny accent where 'M' becomes 'YEM', 'H' is 'HECH' and Pritam became Preetham. However, Ek 'Tha' Tiger is always Ek 'Taa' Tiger...

I hated Bangalore, I hated Idli and Dosa, I hated Lemon Rice and I hated the way they cook Chicken Butter Masala with coconut. I hated the accent, I hated the language (for some of them behaved like we are not humans 'cause we can't speak Kannada), and I almost lost a few teeth trying to pronounce the name of the different places, especially the one where my college is... Soldevanahalli. (My mom still cannot pronounce it,and everytime she called me and I was not reachable, she thought I was kidnapped because of the way the voice says in Kannada that the phone was not reachable), I hated the traffic, the people, the rush, the buses and their fares...

Homesickness and lovesickness consumed me. But I couldn't just leave the place; my parents had spent so much on me,and so I thought I shouldn't complain. I should, instead, try to fall in love with the place.

Slowly, and it was really slowly,I made friends, lots of friends, a few very good friends. I started liking my college, the classes, those proxies, eating at canteen and not paying... I made a few girl friends too...

But Bangalore gave me more than that.

It's the place where I started writing poetry, and short stories... It's the place where I first sang my own compositions and was praised. It's the place where I sold my first painting, got published, and it's the place where I got acquainted with some real good artists from the industry...

But that's not the end...

The best part was that those people whom I hated when I landed here gave me some of the best memories of my life, be the lemon rice (and it was really tasty) a friend used to get for me from home when I was sick or another friend dropping me to hostel every day when I was not capable of walking... And those teachers who gave extra attendance to me throughout my engineering...

Bangalore is the place where I started smoking. It's here I tasted alcohol for the first time, smoked weed, missed the last bus to hostel and spent the entire night on a roadside bench... It's here I got beaten by a police, I was thrown out of Hard Rock Cafe, danced with unknown girls in a club (and later came to know that a few of them were my seniors). It was here I lost many friends, cried, got many other friends, laughed with them like crazy... It's here I punched a guy, also got a black eye... It's here I got insomnia...

I spent hours in BMTC buses travelling around the city, making sketches... It's here I got the first two jobs of my life, as a call center agent (yes,I have learnt to talk in this city)...

And the best part, it's here I got the love of my love - my best friend I had lost on the day I arrived here, this city taught me what love means, it's here I lost my virginity, had innumerable break ups and patch ups ...

I got promoted from 'Bhaiya' to 'Uncle' in this city in the last six years, and now, when it's time to leave Bangalore, I realize how much I love this city and its people...

The memories will warm me up and tear me apart as well. It was the most beautiful phase of my life...
