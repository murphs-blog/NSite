As I look at the extinguished past and violated privacies of today, I see there floats in between them the debris of two souls, broken dreams and the forgotten meaning of hollow words...

I go back in time... I see both of us had preferred coffee to tea. Both of us licked our fingers in KFC. We both were obsessed with reading novels, writing poetry, shopping. SRK was our favourite actor. We both cried watching Titanic.

Both of us loved texting.

And may be that's why we came close to each other, became friends and even more than that and ended up marrying. 

We understood each other more than anyone else did. And may be that's why I started believing that we were made for each other, that no one else in this world could love me more than she loved me, and that my love is enough for her.

As the monsoon finds its way into my already devastated room through the broken window pane, I realise there was never a wall in between us, but neither was there any string attached...

Yes, even after 10 years of our marriage, we are still madly in love.. _Me with her... And she with someone else...._
